  @brief    This is just to gice you some information about catalan numbers.
            Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems like following.

            > Count the number of expressions containing n pairs of parentheses which are correctly matched. For n = 3,
              possible expressions are ((())), ()(()), ()()(), (())(), (()()).
            > Count the number of possible Binary Search Trees with n keys (See this)
            > Count the number of full binary trees (A rooted binary tree is full if every vertex has either two
              children or no children) with n+1 leaves.
            > Given a number n, return the number of ways you can draw n chords in a circle with 2 x n points
              such that no 2 chords intersect.

            The first few Catalan numbers for n = 0, 1, 2, 3, â€¦ are 1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862

      for (int j = 0; j < i; j++)
