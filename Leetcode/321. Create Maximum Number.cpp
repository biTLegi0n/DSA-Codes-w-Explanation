/**
  @brief    This question is a combination of multiple topics and also one of the best question i have encountered so far.
            Before solving this question, you need have knowledge about merge sort technique and also you need to solve
            its prerequisite question (1673. Find the Most Competitive Subsequence)https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence/
            First, Try that question and if you dont get any intuition, don't feel bad. Even i took some help. You can read its
            editorial from here(https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence/discuss/1903056/C%2B%2B-Stack-Solution-intuition-or-Monotonic-Stack)

            *Basic Idea* of this problem is that we two arrays, so we find the largest 'i' digit number from nums1 and largest
            'k-i' digit number from nums2. After having these two, we merge them using merge sort algorithm. We use merge sort
            because it can be proved that largest number will always be sorted in descending order. The only thing to keep in mind
            while merging is the case where array elements are equal. In that case, we have to loop untill we find a greater element
            in one of the two arrays and then act accordingly.
            So after finding a i digit number from nums1 and k-i digit number from nums2, we merge them to form the maximum k digit
            number from these two arrays.
