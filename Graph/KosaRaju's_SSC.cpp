/*
If we sort all vertices vâˆˆV by decreasing of their exit moment tout[v] then the first vertex u is going to be a vertex from "root" 
strongly connected component, i.e. a vertex that no edges in a condensation graph come into. Now we want to run such search from 
this vertex u so that it will visit all vertices in this strongly connected component, but not others; doing so, we can gradually
select all strongly connected components: let's remove all vertices corresponding to the first selected component, and then let's find
a vertex with the largest value of tout, and run this search from it, and so on.

    Let's consider transposed graph GT, i.e. graph received from G by reversing the direction of each edge. Obviously, this graph will have the
same strongly connected components as the initial graph. Moreover, the condensation graph GSCC will also get transposed. It means that there
will be no edges from our "root" component to other components.
